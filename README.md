- 🔭 I used to work as a Generalist Programmer at BBI during 2021-2022 and worked on Minecraft Legends
- 🎮 I am a fan of Dwarf Fortress, and I am creating my own simulation game [Deep Dive](https://youtu.be/Rd8E-iSiLZ0)!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CG concept design from CGPB -> learning to use RenderMan to build custom CGI pipeline
- 🚀 I am also working on some cool concept software called "[Parcel](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Parcel)" (now available as [Expresso](https://charles-zhang.itch.io/expresso)) (Nowadays I recommend just using [Pure](https://github.com/Pure-The-Language) instead)
- 🌎 The latest mega-project I am working on (besides the long-term mysterious [Project Nine](https://nine.totalimagine.com/ArtOfAI)) is called "The Matrix"
- 🧡 My favorite programming languages (among others) are: C#, C++, Prolog, Elixir, and Lua.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with developing a new scripting language (~~[Formless](https://github.com/chaojian-zhang/FormlessProgramming)~~ Nope, let's do [Pure](https://github.com/Pure-The-Language) instead😆)
- 👯 And to carry on my semi-finished work on [Somewhere](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Somewhere/Somewhere) (maybe [Somewhere 2](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Somewhere/Somewhere2))
- 💬 Ask me about anything!
- 📫 How to reach me: charles@totalimagine.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am not religious but I am deeply spiritual
- 🧘‍♀️ Another fun fact: Experimenting with lucid dreams💤
